# HCAHPS-Patient-Survey-Analysis
This is a National & state-level scores from 2013 to 2022 for the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey, a national, standardized survey of hospital patients about their experiences during a recent inpatient hospital stay in United States.

This project is part of Maven Analytics' Data challenge and data sets are downloaded from their site.

Following are the questions to be answered after analysis

• Have hospitals made improvements in their quality of care over the past 9 years?

• Are there any specific areas where hospitals have made more progress than others?

• Are there still any major areas of opportunity?

• What recommendations can you make to hospitals to help them further improve the patient experience?

The attached Powerpoint presentation shows the steps and processes of analysis, findings and recommendations to improve the quality of hospitals care.
